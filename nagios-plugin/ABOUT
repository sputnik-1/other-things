This is a Nagios plugin I wrote to monitor that an API daemon was still up and running.
When the daemon was running it wrote regularly to a log file.
This Nagios plugin searches backwards from the end of the log file to check an API daemon 
is still writing it's output to the log file - which indicates the service is still working OK.
